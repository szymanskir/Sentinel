I studied Computer Science, and my passion for UI development led me to switch to product design after being coding for more than 10 years.

Those are actually three distinct nouns you are trying to order as one: \u5730\u57df reads \u3061\u3044\u304d (Hiragana for `chiiki`), means area; \u8a00\u8a9e reads \u3052\u3093\u3054 (Hiragana for `gengo`), means language; \u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 read opushon, is, you guessed, option in English. Note I didn't write that \u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 means option. \u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 IS the word `option` written with Japanese sounds or, in other words, written in the Japanese script - i.e. Katakana, you guess it.\nSo \u5730\u57df\u3068\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 can be translated as &quot;Regional and Language options&quot;.<p>Quoting from &quot;Sorting Names&quot;\n&quot;It is very possible to have different people with the same name write their name in different character sets. The traditional way of writing the Japanese name of Ayumi would be written in kanji; a modern, stylish way would be to write it in hiragana, and a second generation Japanese-American might write their name in katakana or the alphabet.&quot;\nJapanese always writes their name in Kanji. They don't use different sets. When the Kanji composing their names can assume several sounds, they write alongside what's called Furigana, the Kanji reading - usually as a subscript or superscript. Furigana is written in Hiragana (not Katakana as you stated later on), but for the Internet where websites could potentially be read by a non-Japanese crowd, Katakana might be used in some cases. Nonetheless as I said earlier Hiragana and Katakana differ only by scripting style, if you wish to call it as such. So which script is in use, it's not a relevant issue for foreigners.\nAll the other statements are a matter of opinion, save for the last: Japanese do write sometimes their names in the romaji, aka &quot;ABC alphabet&quot;, especially when they are dealing with foreigners at any level. Although why, being 2nd gen Japanese-American entails writing its own name in Katakana, beats me. It's a tiny bit like saying, forgive me here, a 2nd gen Italian-American would write its name in Latin.<p>Quoting from &quot;Kanji - The Real Problem&quot;:\n&quot;Kanji have multiple pronunciations, determined by the context in which it appears.[...]Only from the context in which the kanji appears do you know how to pronounce it.&quot;\nThat's like saying the pronunciation of the word 'pool' is determined by the context referring to water or balls. Not the pronunciation, but the meaning of the word is changed by the context. We all agree on this statement.\nSingle Kanji words change along with their meaning based on the context, but like the word 'pool', its reading is the same. e.g. \u3042\u3081 (reads ame) which means 'candy' if written \u98f4 or 'rain' if written \u96e8 . In this case the Kanji itself controls its meaning and reading, not the context. When single Kanji is a verb the meaning and reading changes with what's called Okurigana - Hiragana written after the Kanji absolving the purpose of conjugation -, while the Kanji remains invariant. For example \u7740\u304f and \u7740\u308b reads \u3064\u304f (tsuku) and \u304d\u308b (kiru) respectively, the former means 'to arrive' and the latter 'to wear'. Single Kanji aren't at all like you describe them.      \nCompound Kanji words follow a different ruleset build upon how many they are. Generally speaking one kanji in two-Kanji words has multiple readings depending on what is the word it appears in and where it appears in that word. You can learn the rules, or you can get used to them just by seeing them used in massive frequency. This case alone is as you've described: the need to know the context in which the Kanji lives. But since the meaning also changes with its reading, you could be able to catch the overall meaning of the sentence without being able to read that single word. But compounds Kanji with multiple readings aren't that recurring and they generally represents common words requiring not much effort to memorize.\nCompound Kanji words composed by more than two Kanji reads unequivocally in one way as English words do with very few exceptions.\nMore here <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E5%BD%A2%E7%95%B0%E9%9F%B3%E8%AA%9E\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E5%BD%A2%E7%95%B0%E9...</a>\nIf anything what could, quote &quot;[...]keeps students up nights studying for years[...]&quot; isn't the multiple Kanji readings, but the fact that you need to know between 2000 and 3000 Kanji and its their combinations that build words (mostly two Kanji words). So it's like having a permutation with repetition (in ordered arrangements) of 3000 syllables that makes words in pairs or singularly.<p>Quoting &quot;Here is an example: \u79c1\u306f\u79c1\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u3067\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002[...]A second year Japanese student could figure this out. For a computer, this is a very difficult problem.&quot;\nThe choice is particularly sad. This isn't difficult at all for a computer, granting you understand the Japanese language. Let's dissect this phrase:\n\u79c1 \u306f \u79c1\u7acb\u5927\u5b66 \u3067 \u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \n\u79c1 \u308f\u305f\u3057 (reads watashi) is the English pronoun 'I'. A computer instantly knows it because only the watashi reading/meaning can be followed by the Hiragana \u306f. That's something a 6 years old Japanese knows. And something you would learn in your first months or less of Japanese studies.\nConversely a computer know instantly that's the reading/meaning isn't watashi when it scans that following \u79c1, there's another Kanji. This compound Kanji \u79c1\u7acb reading can only be \u3057\u308a\u3064 (reads shiritsu) out of a staggering number of combined readings of 2 - and that's only because \u7acb has two usable Chinese reading \u308a\u3085\u3046 and \u308a\u3064 (the third would require the Kanji to be lonesome), \u79c1 only one, \u3057. Kanji have usually one Japanese reading and one or more Chinese readings governed by strict rules on which reading group has to be used. Coding it isn't as much of a headache.\nAs soon as the computer realize that the third character that follows the first two Kanji is a Kanji as well, the range of possible readings bottoms. That's also due to the fact the first two Kanji makes already a word - as often happens with 2+ long Kanji words, they are compose of multiple words, just like some long words in Western languages would - that means 'private' in English. With the same approach the computer instantly finds the reading of the two Kanji \u5927\u5b66 \u3060\u3044\u304c\u304f (reads daigaku) means University, another very common noun. I think you already got the gist of it. Last word \u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 the computer know instantly is a verb because of the unique okurigana \u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 (read shiteimasu) Present Continuous of &quot;to do&quot; and \u52c9\u5f37 is both extremely popular and has a unique reading, \u3079\u3093\u304d\u3087\u3046 (reads benkyou) which is the noun 'study'. &quot;I'm studying at a private university&quot;, even a machine translation would be accurate here.<p>I think the point is that there is no use in sorting all the words written in the three different Japanese alphabets simultaneously in the same juncture. <em>Microsoft</em> knows it so well it has yet to implement it. In your final thought you completely miss to understand that you don't need to attack the problem by &quot;pronunciations&quot;. You have only to treat the Kanji with different approach and translate Hiragana/Katakana in romaji, which it has been done already long time ago.

But really, why assume that you can guess what the benefit would be? Open the code and let the community decide what it can do with it. It doesn't have to come together with an open development process, necessarily.<p>Some other generic benefits that would apply here are the ability to debug issues, and interop/compatibility. The first one is often dismissed on the grounds that most users are unable to do this; but we're talking about dev tooling here, where the target audience has the necessary skills. From my own experience working on open source dev tools, this is probably the biggest benefit - not PRs, but detailed bug reports that already mostly narrow down the problem. In cases where the original bug can be very environment-specific or otherwise hard to repro, this can make the difference between resolved and closed as no-repro.<p>Interop/compatibility is also an important angle, and very hard to predict in advance. But any extension that interacts with this one, or is used by it, could potentially benefit. This also ties into the ability to debug it somewhat - if extension A breaks extension B, it's much easier for the author of A to figure out why, exactly, and what's the best way to avoid it, if they have the source for B.<p>Then there's the ethical angle.

But really, why assume that you can guess what the benefit would be? Open the code and let the community decide what it can do with it. It doesn&#x27;t have to come together with an open development process, necessarily.<p>Some other generic benefits that would apply here are the ability to debug issues, and interop&#x2F;compatibility. The first one is often dismissed on the grounds that most users are unable to do this; but we&#x27;re talking about dev tooling here, where the target audience has the necessary skills. From my own experience working on open source dev tools, this is probably the biggest benefit - not PRs, but detailed bug reports that already mostly narrow down the problem. In cases where the original bug can be very environment-specific or otherwise hard to repro, this can make the difference between resolved and closed as no-repro.<p>Interop&#x2F;compatibility is also an important angle, and very hard to predict in advance. But any extension that interacts with this one, or is used by it, could potentially benefit. This also ties into the ability to debug it somewhat - if extension A breaks extension B, it&#x27;s much easier for the author of A to figure out why, exactly, and what&#x27;s the best way to avoid it, if they have the source for B.<p>Then there&#x27;s the ethical angle.
